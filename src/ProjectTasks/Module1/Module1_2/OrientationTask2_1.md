## Simulating Arrival Events and Service Start

### (W) a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?

**Purpose:**
- Ensures continuity of the simulation.
- Reflects system dynamics and handles variability.
- Captures arrival patterns.
- Facilitates subsequent events.

### (W) b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?

**Purpose:**
- Generates a service completion event.
- Updates the system state.
- Enables resource release.
- Triggers subsequent events.
- Collects performance metrics.
