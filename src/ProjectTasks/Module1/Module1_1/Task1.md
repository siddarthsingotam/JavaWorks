## How Simulation can be better than real world testing

* Need for optimizing an existing system. It is not a good idea to
  apply the changes to the existing system directly which costs too much.

* Low costs for testing behaviours. It is
  much easier to apply the changes to the simulation framework and analyze the
  results.

* Can solve complex tasks which cannot be handled by metal process alone.

* Time usage: Less time is taken for testing with computer simulation, rather than a real life testing. What it takes in
  months for human can be completed ina span of hours or minutes for computers.

* A simulation model can be used to study a complex real-world system.
  For a real-world system, it will be complex to build a mathematical
  model. A model is based on the assumptions about a real-world system.
  But compared with the simulation model, there will be more assumptions in the mathematical model as the information
  about the
  real-world system is less precise and hard to measure. It is more sustainable.
